# Quantum-networking-papers
This repo contains some of the papers and publications, I have read over the past few months, that pertain to quantum technology development.
It is not a curated list of the most recommended publications for a beginner in the quantum networking field, but rather a journal (of sorts) that depics my journey through publications.
Re-curring topics on this list are:
- Quantum protocol design
- Quantum algorithms
- The Quantum internet
- Silicon based quantum technologies
- The Hong-Ou-Mandel effect
- Quantum circuits 
- Quantum error correction
- Electron-spin states
- Commercial and philosophical views on quantum technologies
- Quantum repeater architectures
- Quantum memories
- Experimental simulating tools
- Quantum markets and hype
- Quantum Machine Learning (QML)
  - QML for Earth Observation

The following papers are available in this repo (in order):

- On Circuit-based Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks for Remote Sensing Imagery Classification - Alessandro Sebastianelli, Daniela A. Zaidenberg, Dario Spiller, Bertrand Le Saux, Silvia Liberata Ullo https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09484 or https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9647979
