# Quantum-networking-papers
This repo contains some of the papers and publications, I have read over the past few months, that pertain to quantum technology development.
It is not a curated list of the most recommended publications for a beginner in the quantum networking field, but rather a journal (of sorts) that depics my journey through publications.
Re-curring topics on this list are:
- Quantum open hardware
- QML
- Nonlinear optoelectronic processes in graphene

The following papers are available in this repo (in order):
- Electrically tunable nonlinear plasmonics in graphene nanoislands
       https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6725
- Giant enhancement of third-harmonic generation in graphene–metal heterostructures
       https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-020-00808-w
- Open Hardware in Quantum Technology - Nathan Shammah, Anurag Saha Roy, Carmen G. Almudever, Sébastien Bourdeauducq, ...
       https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17233.pdf
- Physics-Informed Quantum Machine Learning: Solving nonlinear differential equations in latent spaces without costly grid evaluations - Annie E. Paine, Vincent E. Elfving, & Oleksandr Kyriienko1
       https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01827.pdf
- Quantum computing with graphene plasmons
       https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0150-2
- Single-Photon Nonlinear Optics with Graphene Plasmons
