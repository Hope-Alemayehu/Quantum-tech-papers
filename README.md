# Quantum-networking-papers
This repo contains some of the papers and publications, I have read over the past few months, that pertain to quantum technology development.
It is not a curated list of the most recommended publications for a beginner in the quantum networking field, but rather a journal (of sorts) that depics my journey through publications.
Re-curring topics on this list are:
- Quantum open hardware
- QML

The following papers are available in this repo (in order):
- Open Hardware in Quantum Technology - Nathan Shammah, Anurag Saha Roy, Carmen G. Almudever, SÃ©bastien Bourdeauducq, ...
       https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17233.pdf
- Physics-Informed Quantum Machine Learning: Solving nonlinear differential equations in latent spaces without costly grid evaluations - Annie E. Paine, Vincent E. Elfving, & Oleksandr Kyriienko1
       https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01827.pdf
- What can we learn from quantum convolutional neural networks? - Chukwudubem Umeano, Annie E. Paine, Vincent E. Elfving, & Oleksandr Kyriienko
